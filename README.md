# IR2PW_and_IR2TB
to compute irreducible representations by linking the library (libIRVSP.a) to PW code and TB model.


# ir2pw
to compute irreducible representations by linking the IRVSP library to plane-wave (PW) DFT packages.

src_ir2pw_QE.tar.gz  :interface with the Quantuam-Express DFT package.
                      according to the CRTs on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS).

src_ir2pw_VASP.tar.gz:interface with the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package.
                      according to the CRTs on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS).


# ir2tb
to compute irreducible representations by linking the IRVSP library to tight-binding (TB) model. </br>
It works for phonon, elctron, magnon states.

src_ir2tb_v1.tar.gz : for symmorphic crystals 
                      according to the character tables (CRTs) of point-group (PNG) symmetries.

src_ir2tb_v2.tar.gz : for all crystals 
                      according to the CRTs on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS).
